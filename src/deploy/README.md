# [LOTUS-IPA] Deployment Documentation
First of all, here are some important notes:
- The bash scripts and commands provided are designed for Linux-based systems.
- Since we are building a mobile application, this documentation focuses solely on server-side deployment.

## ‚ö° TL;DR
Backend server is deployed to `Cloud Run`, a fully managed compute platform on `Google Cloud Platform (GCP)`

Before proceeding, ensure that your local environment is properly set up ‚Äî this includes the gcloud CLI, necessary permissions, and project configuration.


*If you want to deploy by yourself, let's begin...*

## Prepare your GCP 
First, head to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in.

Make sure you have an active GCP subscription (the Free Trial works too)

### Create a project
If you already have a GCP project, great ‚Äî you can skip this step.

Otherwise, follow [Google's official guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) to create a new project.

> üìù All subsequent actions and resources will be associated with the GCP project you've created

### Enable related services, APIs
Find services and enable the following services:
