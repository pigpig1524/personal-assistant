    "content": "Dear Mr.Tu,\n\nWe are reaching out to inform you about an important security feature that can help protect your Google account: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step in addition to your password. This means that even if someone obtains your password, they will not be able to access your account without the second factor, typically a code sent to your phone or generated by an authenticator app.\n\nTo enable 2FA on your Google account, please follow these steps:\n1. Sign in to your Google Account.\n2. Navigate to the Security section.\n3. Click on '2-Step Verification' and then 'Get Started.'\n4. Follow the prompts to set up your phone number or authenticator app.\n\nEnabling 2FA greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and helps keep your personal information safe.\n\nIf you need assistance setting up Two-Factor Authentication, please visit the Google Account Help Center or contact our support team.\n\nThank you for taking this important step to secure your account.\n\nBest regards,\nGoogle Security Team\n\nDate: Friday, May 09, 2025"
